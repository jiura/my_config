Switch "netrw.vim" in folder "...\nvim\share\nvim\runtime\autoload" for the one here.
That's a fix for netrw preview winsize not working properly when vertically split. (although I don't really use it anymore)

Drop .clang-format on any parent directory of the one you're in right now, e.g. the work folder with all projects.
